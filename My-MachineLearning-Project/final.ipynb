If you\\nwant to be religious aren't there more plausable books out there? Seriously,\\nthe bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each\\nother. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next\\nit says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow a\\ndeity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one they\\ninvented.\\n\\n      For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didn't god say not to\\nEVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn't god\\nsay not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don't you think\\nthat if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?\\n\\nWas Jesus illiterate? Why didn't he write anything? Anyone know?\\n\\n      I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that\\nit is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the\\npoorer quality ones to boot.

None of his A-1 through A-5\\nantineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against\\nexperimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against\\nleukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce\\ntoxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth\\nof the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)\\n\\nBurzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1\\nand A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been\\nextracted from A-2. He also hasn\\'t shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually\\ndistinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10\\nagainst a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines\\nfrom tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and\\nsmall-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous\\nsystem, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited\\nneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.\\n\\nIt is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski\\'s\\ntheory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to\\nPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying\\npeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for\\nantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1\\nmixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a\\nchemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically\\nextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are\\nhabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects\\nof thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10\\ndoes not appear to have been tested for it\\'s potential to induce\\nteratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\nMany of Burzynski\\'s statements about the origin of his theory, early\\nresearch, past and present support by others for his work have been\\nshown to be untrue.\\n\\n\\nsdb\\n---\\nsdb@ssr.com\\n\\n',\n",

(I\\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).\\n\\nI\\'ve run into two problems; I\\'m sure that other readers have tried this\\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\\n\\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I\\'m\\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\\n\\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\\nshape?\\n\\nCurrently I take:\\n\\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\\n\\nand produce:\\n            \\n             1  2  3  4\\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\\n                                    61 62 63 64\\n\\nLine 1 follows the slope.

This is why there appears to\\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\\'t have to\\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I\\'ve decided that this\\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\\na real perspective drawing.\\n\\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help.\\n\\n-- \\nTill next time,                \\\\o/   \\\\o/\\n                                V \\\\o/ V     email:pinky@tamu.edu\\n<>  Sam  Inala  <>                 V\\n\\n',\n",

All the clamor \\nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \\ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \\ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \\ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \\nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \\nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \\nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \\nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \\nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \\nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \\nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \\nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \\npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \\nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \\nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \\nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \\nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \\nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \\nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \\ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \\nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\\n\\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \\na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \\nwarrented.\\n\\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \\nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \\nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \\ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \\nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \\nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \\nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \\nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \\nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \\nrestricting calcium intake.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \\nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn\\'t it make sense for humans \\nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \\nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \\nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \\ninfections should decline.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n",

This pursuit always fails.\\n\\n>  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I'm being vague. \\n>The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.

Science\\nand religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional\\nanswers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful\\nquestions.

L. \\nacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily \\nresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of \\nthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. \\nbulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are \\nmuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told \\nme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several \\ndifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn\\'t \\ntold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative \\nanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a \\nchance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria \\naround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal \\nregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida \\nblooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from \\nthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I\\'m not ready to buy that yet.  I do \\nbelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower \\ncolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the \\ncompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.\\nRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get \\nrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A \\nsupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the \\ngood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the \\npH to basically starve the candida out.\\n\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n",

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not \\nall calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-\\noxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article \\nas a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that \\nconventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably \\nalways will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that \\nyou will be wrong.

I\\'d want a mineral profile run in a clinical \\nchemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of \\ncalcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to \\nmeasure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don\\'t think that the \\nserum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).

His notebooks\\ncontained fantasies of becoming the \"Newton of mirror-image life,\" which\\nhe never admitted publically.\\n\\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\\n\\nLet\\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\\nto the Septuagint.\\n\\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\nhave little theological import.\\n\\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\\nmaterial, but so far this hasn\\'t happened.\\n\\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\\nOT, unlike for the NT.\\n-- \\nC.

If god does not help me to\\nkeep the faith, I can\\'t go on. \\n\\nBesides, I am concerned with god\\'s morality and mental health. Does\\nshe really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations,\\nguidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn\\'t\\nshe make the task any easier?

If you rely simply on your reason then you will never\\n: know more than you do now. \\n\\nYour argument is of the type \"you\\'ll know once you try\".\\nYet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed\\nfor many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that \\nthey had lived in a virtual reality.\\n\\nWhat else but reason I can use? I don\\'t have the spiritual means \\nChristians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible.\\nI don\\'t even believe I have a soul.

That\\'s okay because I \\nknow that some of what I\\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \\nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\\'s really \\ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\\'t cover nutrition because if \\nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \\nmedical profession.\\n\\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \\nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \\nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \\nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \\nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \\nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\nElaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \\nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \\n\\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \\nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \\ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \\nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \\nit\\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \\nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \\nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \\nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\nthe candida or not isn\\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \\nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\\nIf it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\nnondiscript.  \\n\\n\\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \\nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \\nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \\nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \\npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \\ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\\'s name, it is an acid loving \\norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \\ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \\nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \\nantibiotics).  \\n\\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \\ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \\nduring a woman\\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \\nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \\nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \\nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \\nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \\nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \\nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \\nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \\nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \\ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \\nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \\nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \\nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \\nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \\naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \\nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \\nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \\nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \\nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \\ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\\n \\nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \\nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \\nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \\nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \\nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \\nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \\nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \\nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \\nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\\'s not going to out \\ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \\nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \\nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\\n\\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \\nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \\naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor\\'s use of vitamin \\nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \\nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \\ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart\\'s content.  If you saved \\nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \\nseeking help alone, I wouldn\\'t have a problem with your behavior. \\n \\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n1111 West 17th St.\\nTulsa, Ok. 74107\\n\\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \\nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\".\\n',\n",

There is an XView version called xvgr for\\nSuns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr. Compiling \\nxmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1 and X11R4 - xmgr will \\nnot compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.  X11R5+Motif 1.2 should work \\nfine, but I've not been able to test this.\\n\\nFor a summary of xmgr's capabilities, get the file BLURB from\\neither site mentioned below.\\n\\nAvailable via anonymous ftp to either:\\n\\nftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu:/CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Z\\n\\nor\\n\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Z\\n\\nPlease remember to set the transfer type to binary.\\n\\nI am not able to E-mail xmgr, but there are services provided \\nby various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail. You might try \\nsending mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com as follows:\\n\\nSubject: (hit return) Body-of-letter: help (return) quit\\n\\nI've not tried this, but it should give you instructions on how \\nto use this service.\\n\\n2.10 has been compiled and tested on:\\n\\n IBM RS6000 - AIX 3.2 X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n DECstation - Ultrix 4.2a X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n SGI Indigo - Irix 4.0.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n Sun SPARC  - SunOS 4.1.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n HP 720     - HP-UX 8.05 X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n\\nCompiling with gcc should be no problem, but use settings \\nappropriate for K&R C.\\n\\nOf interest:\\n\\nIn light of recent announcements (COSE), I'm suspending further \\ndevelopment of the XView version. For those without Motif on \\nSUNs, I'll provide a compiled binary (eventually).\\n\\nI've begun re-writing ACE/gr in C++, the initial target is\\nMS-Windows.\\n\\nImprovements/fixes from 2.09 are:\\n\\n * The explicit placement of items in popups has been replaced\\n\\twith manager widgets. The previous method led to problems\\n\\ton some servers (all widgets in a popup would get scrunched\\n\\tinto the upper left corner).\\n\\n * Many set operations can now be done in the File/Status popup.\\n\\n * The PostScript driver should do a better job of producing\\n\\tEPSF'able output.\\n\\nA few things remain to do (I could use some ideas/help on these):\\n\\n1. Replace the Hershey fonts used for on-screen text with the\\n\\txvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson.\\n\\tThe problem here is how to include support for this in the\\n\\tuser interface.\\n\\n2. Add support for Adobe Font Metrics. I could use some PD or freely\\n\\tdistributable routines for this.\\n\\n3. Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver. Presently\\n\\tthe only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF into\\n\\tFrameMaker. Need PS routines for pattern fills.\\n\\n4. Add support for HDF/NetCDF.

She said even common ear infections frequently seen in\\nchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n\"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases\\nwould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases\\nremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness\\nand death in the United States,\" the CDC said.\\n\\nIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a \"myriad\" of newly\\nidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a\\ndeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that\\ncauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\n\"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,\\nsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,\"\\nthe CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been\\nundermined by drug resistance.\\n\\n=====*=====\\n\\nSOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL\\nREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1\\nHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues\\n\\nThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause\\ndamage: legal liability.\\n\\nA federal judge\\'s decision holding a property owner liable for not\\ndoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much\\nattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like\\nillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in\\nrare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners\\non notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from\\nthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if\\nsomeone becomes infected while on the property.\\n\\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came\\nafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the\\nLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the\\ndisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered\\nthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than\\n$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical\\nexpenses and lost wages.\\n\\nSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or\\nsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the\\ngroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.\\nKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a\\nlegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential\\nliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard\\nbarbecue might be potentially liable.\\n\\nLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren\\'t unheard-of. A summer\\nvacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home\\nshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky\\nMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered\\nan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was\\nstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent\\nquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence\\nthat a beehive was near the restaurant.\\n\\nBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the\\ncountry -- it\\'s most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic\\nstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this\\nparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.\\n\\nThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the\\ncourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will\\ncover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not\\ndiagnosing the disease.\\n\\nLawyers say worker\\'s-compensation claims related to Lyme disease\\nhave become common in some states in recent years. Payments in\\nworker\\'s-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and\\nlost earnings.\\n\\nThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more\\nlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of\\nnegligence. Unlike the worker\\'s compensation process, the law governing\\ninjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a\\nresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property\\nowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many\\nother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the\\ndisease.\\n\\nIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &\\nMaurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help\\nto establish \"the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect\\nagainst Lyme disease.\"\\n\\nLawyers caution that despite Judge Ward\\'s decision, winning a\\nlawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For\\none thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when\\nand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs\\nin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned\\nby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.\\nThe workers, who weren\\'t outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to\\nthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded\\nsome work sites.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that\\nthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is\\nconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward\\'s finding\\nthat it didn\\'t do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says\\nthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special\\npants to protect against bug bites.\\n\\nDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up\\nsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a\\nvictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.\\nEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association\\nreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.\\nAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical\\ndisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.\\n\\nBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies\\nalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last\\nyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &\\nCo. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston\\nthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-\\nsupply company\\'s headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company\\nwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might\\nget infected.\\n\\nRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in\\nIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her\\norganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole\\nKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners\\nAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their\\n100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing\\npesticide.\\n\\n=====*=====\\n\\nTITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.\\nAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,\\nDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson\\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\nREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30\\n\\nLyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is\\nassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients\\nwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.\\nUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and\\ndetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not\\nnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract\\nmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding\\ndysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may\\ndirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the\\nLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological\\nsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was\\nprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological\\ndeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme\\ndisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential\\ndiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder\\nmanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic\\nevaluation is recommended.\\n\\n\\nIV. ***** QUESTIONS \\'N\\' ANSWERS *****\\n\\nNote: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to the\\neditor.\\n\\nSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>\\nSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles\\n\\n  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the\\ncompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became\\ninfected.\\n\\n  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to\\nback that claim up with documentation.

Here are some observations gained from\\npainful experience:\\n\\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\\n\\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\\n     that these things will itch for months.\\n\\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\\'s special\\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\\n     required to get it.\\n\\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\\'t work.  I recall\\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\\n\\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\\n     up on weekends since I literally can\\'t go outside where we\\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\\n     apparently don\\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\\n\\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\\'t tell you all the things I\\'ve tried.\\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\\n     it gains nothing).\\n\\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\\n     as well.\\n\\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\\ndoctors apparently don\\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\\nwould make a *lot* of money.\\n-- \\nGary H.

There is always a driving purpose behind\\nthought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively \\n\"pure\", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it\\'s \"impure\", e.g. pursuit\\nof money, or of physical pleasure. But it\\'s always there. And even when it\\nis a \"pure\" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in order\\nto personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So there\\nis still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in the\\napproach of the \"detached, objective\" scientist. \\n\\n>>Now if we\\'re valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,\\n>>science cannot be valued non-subjectively.

There are two senses\\nin which we can say that the phenomenon of \"the working of the DES chip\" is \\nvalue-based:\\n\\n\\t1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES\\n\\t   chip and started it running in the first place\\n\\n\\t\\tand\\n\\n\\t2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of \"works\" has value\\n\\t   associated with it\\n\\nThe first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to \\nwork. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more \\nsubtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute \"works\" is \\nitself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ \\nfact, not just a fact-in-itself.

I\\'m\\n>trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated.\\n>Thanks.\\n\\nYou\\'ve asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which\\nare used for chemotherapy.\\n\\nThe overall purpose of chemotherapy (don\\'t worry about the spelling.  Some of\\nthese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy\\ncancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different\\neffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than\\none drug at a time.\\n\\nSome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle\\nof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.\\n\\nThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis\\nand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.\\nThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized \\naagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.\\n\\nThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.\\nOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.\\nAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells\\nto stop growing.\\n\\nIf what you are seeking is \"practical\" advice, I apologize for rambling\\non the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs\\nare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to \\nexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small\\nfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter\\nknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines\\ntthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications \\ncan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.\\n\\nProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always\\nhappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person \\nthemself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different\\nside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug\\nheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably\\nby reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this\\ntoo, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.\\n\\nI highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.\\nThey have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,\\nif your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend \"Reach for Recovery\".\\nIt is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast \\nbecause of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.\\n\\nIf you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good\\naccess to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.\\n\\nI wish the best to you and your friend.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I still believe\\nthat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would\\nnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent\\nthe many hours in Stanford\\'s Med Library as I have done.\\nAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that \\nwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank\\ngoodness I didn\\'t.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine\\nthat helps me.  \\n\\nI think that what you\\'ve said is kind of idealistic.  That you\\nwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second\\nopinion, and then move on with your life.\\nJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in \\nthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.\\nThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over\\nthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going\\nto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was \\nhelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very\\nunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,\\nmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.\\n\\nA recent movie, Lorenzo\\'s Oil, offers a perfect example of what\\nI\\'m talking about.  If you haven\\'t seen it, you should.  It\\'s not\\na put down of doctor\\'s and neither is what I\\'m saying.  Doctors are\\nonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us\\nout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing\\npiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m biased because dizziness is one of those weird things\\nthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,\\nor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That\\'s because \\nthose things are much more tangible and have much more concise \\ndefinitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to\\ndecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to\\nfind your way out of it.\\n\\n\\nI have chosen the latter.\\n\\n\\nLinda\\nlindae@netcom.netcom.com\\n\\n\\n>\\n>-- \\n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n>Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\\n>geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" \\n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

It is best to do nothing, besides taking some pain\\nmedication initially. Some patients don\\'t like this and expect, or demand,\\nto have something done. In these cases some physicians will \"tape\" the \\npatient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribe\\nan elastic binder.

What he does NOT\\n\\tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on\\n\\thumans but on rabbits.\\n\\n\\tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist\\n\\tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that\\n\\ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get \\n\\theadaches from it.  \\'But,\\' she explains, \\'the show probably \\n\\toveremphasized the extent of the problem.\\'\\n\\n\\tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor\\n\\tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley\\n\\tremarks, \\'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory\\n\\tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters\\' because\\n\\tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney\\'s\\n\\tresearch with lab animals does not \\'show\\' anything about human\\n\\tyoungsters.\\n\\n\\tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney\\'s \\n\\texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected\\n\\textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing \\n\\ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,\\n\\tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance\\n\\tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither\\n\\tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG \\n\\twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by\\n\\tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little\\n\\treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human\\n\\tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations\\n\\tfound in Dr. Olney\\'s lab animals.....\\n\\n\\tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of\\n\\tthat fact.  And so does the European Communities\\' Scientific\\n\\tCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,\\n\\thave concluded that MSG is safe.\\n\\n\\tTheir determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never\\n\\tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed\\n\\tto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a\\n\\tburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe\\n\\tof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently\\n\\texonerated the much-maligned substance.\\n\\n\\tThat\\'s quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of\\n\\tmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever\\n\\twe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one\\n\\tof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken\\n\\tdown into glutamate during digestion.\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the\\n\\tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes\\n\\tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in\\n\\tmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.\\n\\n\\tThat doesn\\'t mean it\\'s entirely unimaginable that a small number\\n\\tof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore\\n\\tsensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international\\n\\tprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus\\n\\treached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\"\\n\\n\\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak\\'s opinions.)\\n',\n",

Rather than being able to use different tools  \\ntogether in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too  \\nmuch time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away  \\ntools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal  \\nrather than what it means to have attained it.\\n\\nWhat we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools  \\nwe choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,  \\nhighly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own  \\nspecialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).   \\nThe use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,  \\nrequiring a very short learning phase and practically no  \\nuser-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different  \\npossibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too  \\nmuch about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).   \\nBy building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able  \\nto draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a  \\nparticular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display  \\nresults, and combine information from many different sources.\\n\\nCurrently, the group consists of people from very different fields:  \\nMolecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.   \\nWhile many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying  \\nmotivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a  \\nsystem which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific  \\ndata and daily work.\\n\\n\\nWhy NeXTSTEP?\\n\\nWhat else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally  \\nobject-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,  \\nhighly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of  \\nNS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range  \\nof hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally  \\navailable.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now  \\nhave little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows  \\nGUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the  \\nmass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer\\'s nightmare (either despite,  \\nor more probably because of, OLE).\\n\\nIn order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop  \\nsuch an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put  \\ntogether a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our  \\n\"Hyper-knowledge\" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What  \\nminimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the  \\nenvironment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are  \\nbest developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools  \\ncan/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need  \\nan \"AVS\"-like tool for data-flow manipulation?\\n\\n\\nMailing list and Anonymous ftp\\n\\nIn order to take part to the project or to push the discussion forewords,  \\nyou are invited to subscribe to: sci-tools@embl-heidelberg.de\\nAll (interesting) suggestions, projects and sources will be archive and  \\nsoon available (anonymous ftp).\\nFor questions send mail to sci-tools-help@embl-heidelberg.de\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany) has  \\nconsented to provide the computer resources for a mailing list and  \\nanonymous ftp services.\\n\\nRick Hessman    <hessman@eden.uni-sw.gwdg.de>\\nGeorg Tuparev   <tuparev@embl-heidelberg.de>\\n',\n",

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\\n\\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\\nspiritual explanations. \\n\\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn\\'t: it is self-\\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \\n\\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\\n\\n There is no need\\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\n: determnined.\\n\\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\\nwill or not? \\n\\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\n: acquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident.\\n\\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \\nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\\nsurvive, those which don\\'t don\\'t make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\\n\\n: For an atheist, no\\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\n: an event can have value. \\n\\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \\n\\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\\nfor starters.\\n\\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\n: establish your values.\\n\\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\\nseverely flawed.\\n\\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\\'s\\nown people.\\n\\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\\nof other nations. \\n\\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\\n\\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n: - that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\n\\nIt looks like you haven\\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \\nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\\nof some physical event), and other\\'s happiness, too, if the observer\\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\\nmeaning. \\n\\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \\npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\\ndo not exist. \\n\\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others\\'\\nexistence.\\n\\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \\n\\n: That you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\n: or God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\n\\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\\n\\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\\ncease to be subjective. \\n\\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \\ninherently subjective. \\n\\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\\nwe don\\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\\'s\\nown and then to get mad at this. \\n\\nGod must be schizophrenic.\\n\\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\n: weight whatsoever.\\n\\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\\n\\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\\n_including_ gods.

(\"Useful in making some conclusion\" is \\n#an accuracy judgement again, I\\'m afraid.) \\n\\nThis is the root of the problem: I bloomin\\' well amn\\'t punning on the\\nword value!!!  I know it\\'s ambiguous.  I\\'ve told you the sense in\\nwhich I\\'m using it (worth, use, goodness, etc).  And value DOESN\\'T mean\\naccuracy, by any stretch of the imagination.  Value=result of a computation,\\nis not what I mean, but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of\\n\\'value\\'.  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  \\n\\nI can only understand that by \\'\"useful in making some conclusion\" is an accuracy\\njudgement\\' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in making\\nthat conclusion or not.   That\\'s part of what I mean by objective\\nvaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn\\'t value x for the \\npurpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn\\'t really do that. The\\nrest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own \\nfreedom) are solid facts in themselves.\\n\\nConsider each of the following statements:\\n\\n(1) The only reason that the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\n\\'inaccurate\\' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  \\n\\n(2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of people\\nfinds the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\'inaccurate\\' useful in\\ndealing with phenomena.\\n\\n(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful in\\nmodelling phenomena.\\n\\nWhere is the \\'pun\\' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  \\nAnd what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that \"the \\nbasis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. \\n\\'subjective\\' values\"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a \\n\\'subjective\\' value judgement?  (an \\'accurate\\' value judgement, maybe?)\\n\\nJust to illustrate what I mean: what\\'s the difference between saying\\n\\'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we have\\nto model phenomena\\' and (say) \\'Love and intelligence are the best tools we have\\nto achieve freedom\\'?  Is one \\'objective\\', the other not?  Both are \\njudgements about value (\"best\"), and both have the same empirical basis, from \\nwhere _I_ sit.\\n\\n#Sorry, Frank, but all you\\'re doing is\\n#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you\\n#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,\\n#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it\\'s based\\n#on value (goodness) judgements, that\\'s nonsense. By contrast,\\n#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I do mean to say that it\\'s based on \"goodness\" judgements.\\n\"Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) \\ntools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate \\npredictions\" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.

The better ones also include\\nadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to\\n \\nwarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.\\n\\nOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has\\na delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing\\nall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.\\nThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their\\nwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don\\'t have to wait for your \\nbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.\\n\\n \\n    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tBright Star\\n\\tTel: +1 (206) 451 3697\\n    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows\\n    Description:\\n\\tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. \\n\\tWarns when to take a break (configurable).

Other information\\n\\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\\n\\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\\n\\n\\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\\n\\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\\n\\tuseful when used with Windows.\\n\\n\\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\\n\\n    Comments:\\n\\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\\n\\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\\n\\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\\n\\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\\n\\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \\n\\tto pay up for RSI management tools.  \\n\\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tRAN Enterprises\\n\\tOne Woodland Park Dr.\\n\\tHaverhill, MA  01830, US\\n\\tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\\n    Description:\\n\\tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\\n\\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally\\n\\tdisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\\n\\tanimated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the\\n\\tcorrect rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training \\n\\texercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions\\n\\tyou do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help \\n\\ton workplace ergonomics.  \\n\\n\\tQuote from their literature:\\n\\n\\t\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic\\n\\tsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work\\n\\tall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent\\n\\tRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve\\n\\tyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these\\n\\thelp you to become more relaxed and productive.\"\\n \\n\\t\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.\\n\\tGodnig, O.D. and John S.

Free demo ($5 outside US).\\n \\n    Comments:\\n\\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\\n\\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\\n\\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\\n\\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\\n\\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\\n\\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\\n\\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\\n\\tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not\\n\\trequire any sound hardware.\\n\\n    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tVisionary Software\\n\\tP.O.

It does not provide exercises, but it does check\\n\\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\\n\\tcan start typing again.  \\n\\n\\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\\n\\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\\n\\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\\n\\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \\n\\n\\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\\n\\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\\n\\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \\n\\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \\n\\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\\n\\n\\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\\n\\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\\n\\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \\n\\tfeedback.\\n\\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\\n    Available from:\\n\\tVarious sources\\n    Platforms: Various\\n    Description:\\n\\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\\n\\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\\n\\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\\n\\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\\n\\tthe screen.\\n\\n\\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\\n\\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI\\'s \\'load=\\' line so\\n\\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\\n\\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\\n\\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\\n\\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\\n\\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \\n\\tfor the next appointment.\\n\\n\\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\\n\\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\\n\\tfile on your \\'run=\\' line, as above, and you will then, with\\n\\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\\n\\twith RSI exercises.\\n\\n\\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \\n\\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\\n\\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\\n\\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\\n\\n\\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \\n\\tyourself to take a break if you can\\'t get hold of a suitable RSI \\n\\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\\n\\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\\n\\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\\n\\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\\n    Available from:\\n\\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\\n    Description:\\n\\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\\n\\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\\n\\tmanually or automatically.  \\n\\n\\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\\n\\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\\n\\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\\n\\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\\n\\tare doing.\\n\\t\\n    Comments:\\n\\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\\n\\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\\n\\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\\n\\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\\n\\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\\n\\n\\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\\n\\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\\n\\twarning of the end of the time period!\\n\\n\\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \\nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \\nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\\nand may therefore make matters worse.\\n\\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\\n    Platforms: UNIX (don\\'t know which ones)\\n    Description:\\n\\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\\n\\tOnly works through tty\\'s (so, you can use it with a terminal or\\n\\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\\n\\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\\n\\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \\n    Description:\\n\\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\\n\\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\\n\\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \\n\\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \\n\\n-- \\nDan Wallach               \"One of the most attractive features of a Connection\\ndwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces\\nOffice#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet.\" -- CM Paris Ref.

The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \\nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \\nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \\ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \\n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \\nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \\nit.\\n\\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \\ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \\ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \\nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser\\'s again: \"However, some factors, such as \\nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \\nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \\nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \\nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \\n\\n\\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

Med. Nutrition and I\\'m posting my answer \\nhere.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human \\nnutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do \\nwhen candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community.\\nI think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the \\nmark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and \\ntheir husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that \\nmost physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by \\ndiet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting \\nyour flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is \\njustified.\\n\\nFrom A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition:\\n> \\tIn a psychological anthropology course I am taking, we got \\n> sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared\\n> by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, sugar\\n> intake, and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms.\\n> \\tIs there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey?\\n> \\n> Many thanks,\\n> \\n> Michael, I\\'ve wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got \\nside-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most \\nphysicians don\\'t recognize it as a specific \"disease\" entity.  Here is \\neverything that you would ever want to know about PMS.\\n\\nPremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:\\n\\n\\tPMT-A(Anxiety)\\t\\tPMT-D(depression)\\n\\tanxiety\\t\\t\\tdepression\\n\\tirritability\\t\\tforgetfulness\\n\\tinsomnia\\t\\tconfusion\\n\\tdepression\\t\\tlethargy\\n\\n\\tPMT-C(Craving)\\t\\tPMT-H(Hyperhydration)\\n\\tcraving for sweets\\tweight gain\\n\\tincreased appetite\\tbreast congestion and tenderness\\n\\tsugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness\\n\\t 1. headache\\t\\tedema of the face and extremities\\n\\t 2. palpitations\\n\\t 3. fatigue or fainting\\n \\nPMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low \\nprogesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women\\'s cycle.\\n\\nPMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple \\ncarbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women\\'s cycle, there is \\nincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose \\nchallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are \\na low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia \\nis not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of \\nhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.\\n\\tA. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).\\nUnrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium \\nsupplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of \\nthe total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources \\nof alpha linoleic acid.\\n\\nPMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \\nphase of a women\\'s cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead \\ntoxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \\nphase). \"Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human \\nendometrial cystol\" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).\\n\\nPMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated \\nserum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E \\nfor breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H\\n\\nThis general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:\\n\\n\\tA. \"Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for \\n\\t    a nutritional approach\". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. \\n\\t    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.\\n\\n\\tB. \"Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension \\n\\t    syndromes\", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).\\n\\n\\tC. \"Premenstrual tension\", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)\\n\\nTreatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can \\nfind a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one \\nthat will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, \\nsupplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really \\nhas been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida \\nblooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental \\ncontrolled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to \\nsee done).\\n\\nHere are a few of these studies:\\n\\n\\tCARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, \"Effect of a low-fat, \\n\\thigh-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy\" Lancet \\n\\t2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy \\n\\tof at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive \\n\\tspecific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories \\n\\tand increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary \\n\\tadvise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant \\n\\treduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in \\n\\tthe trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as \\n\\tphysical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, \\n\\ttenderness and nodularity.\\n\\n\\tVITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, \"The use of Vitamin A in \\n\\tpremenstrual tension\" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  \\n\\t218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU \\n\\tvitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored \\n\\tand high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of \\n\\ttoxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the \\n\\tstudy was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool \\n\\tsize(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this \\n\\tnormal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose \\n\\tvitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% \\n\\tgetting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.\\n  \\t10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS \\n\\tsymptoms.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Controlled Study, \"Premenstrual tension treated with \\n\\tvitamin A\" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts \\n\\treceived 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their \\n\\tcycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.\\n  \\tAfter 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in \\n\\tPMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of \\n\\ttoxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year \\n\\tafter high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms \\n\\tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the \\n\\tvitamin A supplementation was stopped.\\n\\nMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  \\nThese studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal \\nstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins \\ngiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best \\nsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid \\n(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full \\nof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent \\nthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don\\'t want to be trying \\nto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin \\nA toxicity.\\n\\n\\tVITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, \"Pyridoxine\\n\\t(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover \\n\\ttrial\"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 \\n\\twith moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.\\n  \\tAfter 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another \\n\\t3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of \\n\\tPMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS \\n\\twere not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The efects of vitamin B6 \\n\\tsupplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms\" Obstet. Gynecol \\n\\t70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received \\n\\t150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence \\n\\tshowed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related \\n\\tto the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as \\n\\tbehavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)\\n  \\tAnxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 \\n\\tsupplementation.\\n\\nVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control \\npills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  \\nWomen on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per \\nday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. \\nRubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in \\nClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be \\nconsidered the \"first-line\" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the \\npatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin \\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each \\nday. \\n\\n\\n\\tVITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Efficacy of alpha-\\n\\ttocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome\" J. Reprod. \\n\\tMed. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 \\n\\tcycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a \\n\\tsignificant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast \\n\\ttenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant\\n \\treduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% \\n\\thad a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo \\n\\tgroup.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant\\n\\tdecrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The effect of alpha-tocopherol on \\n\\tpremenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study\" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. \\n\\t2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly \\n\\treceived vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After \\n\\t2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly \\n\\timproved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly \\n\\timprove PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H\\n\\t(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve \\n\\tPMT-H symptoms).\\n\\t\\n\\tMAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Magnesium prophylaxis \\n\\tof menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium\" Headache \\n\\t31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg \\n\\tdaily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a \\n\\tplacebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and \\n\\tcontinued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index \\n\\twas significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment \\n\\twas also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual \\n\\tDistress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  \\n\\tlymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower \\n\\tin this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer \\n\\tfrom PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised \\n\\tinto the normal range.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Oral Magnesium successfully \\n\\trelieves premenstrual mood changes\" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). \\n\\t32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid \\n\\t360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the \\n\\tonset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received \\n\\tmagnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \\n\\tpain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the \\n\\tmagnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were \\n\\tswitched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on \\n\\tthe Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by \\n\\tmagnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium \\n\\tsupplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes \\n\\tthat occur during PMS.\\n\\nThere are numerous observational studies that have been published in the \\nmedical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder \\nthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But \\nsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. \\nto be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are \\nalso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on \\nmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I\\'ve chosen the \\nbest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out \\nthat PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don\\'t recognize \\nnutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, \\npellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor \\nbeing trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS \\nis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional \\ndisorders.  It\\'s time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.\\n\\nHere\\'s some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral \\nsupplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Study, \"Effect of a nutritional programme on \\n\\tpremenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis\", Complement. Med. \\n\\tRes.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and \\n\\tsupplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, \\n\\tmagnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to \\n\\ttake the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate \\n\\tdiet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an \\n\\timprovement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that \\n\\tthey no longer suffered from PMS. \\n\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Role of Nutrition in managing \\n\\tpremenstrual tension syndromes\", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  \\n\\tA low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite \\n\\tsupplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet \\n\\tchange and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the \\n\\tvitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased \\n\\testradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel \\n\\tphase of their cycle.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Clinical and biochemical effects \\n\\tof nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome\", J. \\n\\tReprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 \\n\\ttablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a \\n\\tsignificant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another\\n \\tgroup of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this \\n\\tsecond group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on \\n\\tPMS symptoms was observed.\\n\\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n1111 W. 17th St.\\nTulsa, Ok 74107\\n\\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \\nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\" \\n',\n",

The viewpoint I follow -- that there is in general no\\n> punishment for apostasy -- is _very_ strongly supported by Qur\\'an and\\n> hadith.  This is very well shown in the book \"Punishment in Islamic Law\"\\n> by Mohamed S. El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981).\\n> \\n\\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\\'an.\\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \\nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\\n\\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon \"God and\\nHis Messenger\" the situation changes. Now the charge of\\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \\ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \\nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case.\\n\\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation\\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \\nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \\nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \\nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \\nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\\n\\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \\noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\\nMuslims, and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\\n\\n\\n> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter\\n> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.  If someone tells me\\n> \"Islam says such and such\", I immediately say \"show me the support for\\n> this statement from the Qur\\'an and Sunnah\".

I believe\\nthat one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\\nEvery verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\\nimpinge on the situation.\\n\\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an.\\nThe Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\\nthe\\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \\nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \\nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \\nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\\n\\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \\nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\\nthe Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\\nthe Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an....\".\\n\\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic\\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \\nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \\npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\\'ve listed a few major \\ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\\nheadings.\\n\\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\\n- Logic (mantiq)\\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\\nReasoning)\\n\\nThe study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\\n- discussion of tacit meanings\\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\\n\\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\\n- principles of exemption\\n- principles of precaution\\n- principles of option\\n- principles of mastery\\n\\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \\n\\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\\nfamous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says:\\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \\nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?\" He (S.A.) replied:\\n\"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\\n\\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \\ndelineated in the Qur\\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\\nare praised in both the Qur\\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \\nare cautioned.\\n\\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\\napostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least\\nbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a\\nheretic\\nbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of\\ncreating a straw man and then beating him.\\n\\n> Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam.  Please\\n> email me, Rashid, if you think we should do this.\\n\\nI agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.\\nUnfortunately,\\nI do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated\\ngroup\\nis out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like\\nsoc.religion.islam. How about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc?\\n\\nAs salaam a-laikum\\n',\n",

(Some would give Velikovsky or\\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don\\'t like these, choose your\\nown.)

Another kind of\\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \\n\\n> If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\\n> to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\\n> But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This\\n> is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  \\n\\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \\nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\\npresence of qi.\\n\\n> ... In order to have science, one must have a theoretical\\n> structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically\\n> validated random hypotheses.\\n\\nCertainly a \"theoretical structure that makes sense\" is the goal.\\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let\\'s face it: we cannot\\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \\n\\nRussell\\n',\n",

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

By the well known\\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.

The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          PHIGS\".\\n\\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.

FIGARO+ supports immediate\\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\\n\\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\\n\\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company\\'s  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G\\'s data visual-\\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\\n          Starbase.\\n\\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most\\n          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many\\n          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-\\n          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS\\n          or ARENA is available on request.\\n\\n          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-\\n          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most\\n          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-\\n          porates PEX support.\\n\\n          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital\\n          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the\\n          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs\\' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.\\n          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with\\n          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most\\n          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as\\n          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and\\n          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.\\n\\n          AXP, DEC, and DEC PHIGS are trademarks of Digital Equipment  Cor-\\n          poration.

The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and\\nLightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional\\nphoto-realistic images for a variety of purposes.\\n\\n-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --\\n\\nThis mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how\\nit operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images\\navailable to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and\\nLightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the\\npackage.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as\\na group.\\n\\n-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --\\n\\nSince LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster\\nsoftware, I\\'m sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation\\nof the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving\\nspecifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.\\n\\nYou do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!\\n\\n-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --\\n\\nTo become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail\\nmessage to the address:\\n\\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nIn the body of the message enter:\\n\\nsubscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain\\n\\nOr just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this\\npoint in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated\\nscript based system in place soon.  There shouldn\\'t be too much of a\\ndelay in joining.  Expect a \"welcome\" message within 5 days after you\\nsend your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!\\n\\n-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --\\n\\nContributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the\\nfollowing address:\\n\\n        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nYour article will be processed by the system and distributed to all\\nothers joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so\\nyou know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those\\naddresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back\\nto you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no\\nlonger valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean it hasn\\'t been posted to the list.  In fact, just the\\nopposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it\\ncouldn\\'t be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad\\naddress.\\n\\nNOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.\\n\\n-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --\\n\\nSimply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address\\nyou used to sign up:\\n\\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nIn the body of the message enter:\\n\\nunsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain\\n\\nI will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join\\nthe list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be\\nable to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the\\nlist!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send\\na request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend\\nforwarding of the articles to you.\\n\\n\\n-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --\\n\\nI am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the\\noriginating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due\\nto lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a\\ncompendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store\\nthem in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an\\nindex of the contents of the compendium and any other information that\\nrelates.\\n\\nIf there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI\\nhard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>\\n\\nI have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the\\nlist can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past\\narticles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to\\nthe LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please\\nsend a mail message to:\\n\\n        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nThe first command to the server must be \"HELP\" or \"USER name <passwd>\".\\n\\nUse HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.\\nUse USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.\\nUse ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.\\n\\n\\n\\n-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --\\n\\nWell, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have\\nsomething to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to\\nthe list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes\\nsome of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>\\n\\nIf you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact\\nme at the address:\\n\\n        lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\n\\nBob Lindabury\\n',\n",

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".

MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \\nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \\nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \\nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \\nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \\nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \\nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \\nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \\nstandards.\\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa\\'s FlickerFree(tm) technology, \\nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \\ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \\ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \\nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \\noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \\nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \\ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is \\nalso offering this card in the \"TurboBahn\" combination packaged \\nwith their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.\\n        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, \\nWINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \\nvalue.  Genoa\\'s advanced proprietary drivers act to \"turbocharge\" \\nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \\npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \\nchip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \\nreliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D \\nStudio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins \\nare available on Genoa\\'s BBS at (408) 943-1231.\\n        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of \\ngraphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for \\nIBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two \\nyear limited warranty on parts and labor.

To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour\\n> against Rushdie?\\n\\nOnce the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on\\nthe matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes\\nshowing\\nthe dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so\\nnewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there\\nwould\\nappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how\\ndramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the\\nsituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued\\nthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central\\nspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman\\'s\\nright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it\\'s\\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\\n\\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \\nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \\nwas annoying.)\\n\\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\\n\"organized\"\\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a \"secular\" Islam - an Islam\\nseparated from it\\'s Qur\\'an, it\\'s Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\\nmade\\nhis views known - the Muslim\\'s made their anger at his book known. The\\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\\ntime,\\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\\nindividuals.\\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\\nengaged\\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\\n\\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\\n\\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\\nkind, has no\\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in \"boldly\"\\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\\na kind of secular \"heroic Knight\",mounted on the his media steed,\\n doing battle with the \"dragon\" of Islamic \"fundamentalism\".\\n\\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \\ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim\\'s hold dear, \\nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\\nwho, when\\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie\\'s continued media mischief\\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\\n\\n>You\\'re attempts at justification are not doing the\\n> image of Islam any good.\\n\\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. \"Image\" is\\nthe chief concern of Muslim \\'apologists\\' for Islam and for Rushdie.\\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\\nwould then be thought to have a good \"image\" (Principally because it would\\nby and large reflect the secular image). A \"good image\" usually means \" be\\nmore\\nlike me\".\\n\\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\\nthat\\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.\\n\\n>  In Iran, the situation was monitored for many\\n> >months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free\\n> >worldwide voice that the media gave him, the situation was monitored\\n> >more seriously. When, even after many deaths occured worldwide, Rushdie\\n> >still did not desist - the fatwa was pronounced. When behaving like\\n> >a total jerk endangers lives, and the jerk sees this and still insists\\n> >on his right to behave like a total jerk - he has the rug jerked out\\n> >from under him.\\n> \\n> If the muslims didn\\'t make such a big fuss over the book, like issuing\\n> death threats, and killing publishers, NO ONE WOULD HAVE HEARD OF IT.\\n\\nThe fatwa came later - much later. If Rushdie didn\\'t mouth off so much in\\nthe\\nmedia, the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed, no\\nfatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away.\\n',\n",

Everyone,\\n\\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\\nmy question was not so clear. Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\\n\\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \\n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\\nsummary of the answers).\\n\\nYeh\\nUSC\\n',\n",

The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.\\n\\n>Call me a fool, but I believe he did heal people.\\n  \\nThat is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)\\nto become a christian.

More to the\\npoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \\n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \\nhis principles.

The only reasonable way I think\\npeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of\\nmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to\\npresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \\n\\nTony\\'s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \\nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is\\nequal to b because a is equal to b\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n>\\tI don\\'t think most people understand what a Christian is.  \\n\\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \\nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\\nclaiming to be correct.  \\n\\nIt \\n>is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.

You threw in numbers, and I am sick of hearing\\n>about Stalin as an example because the example doesn\\'t apply.  You\\n>managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack\\n>all forms of atheism.\\n\\nIt might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was\\nthat mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who\\nthey will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or\\nhammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it\\'s\\nstill a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also\\nbecause people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he\\nhad wrought.\\n\\n>The evidence I am referring to is more a lack of evidence than negative\\n>evidence.

But, this person\\n>here claims that there are pink crows, even though he admits he hasn\\'t\\n>been able to capture one or get a photo, or find one with me etc.\\n>In a sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crows.\\n>That is what I am saying when I look at the evidence.  I look at the\\n>suppossed evidence for a deity, show how it is flawed, and doesn\\'t show\\n>what theists want it to show, and go on.\\n\\nFirst, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not\\nsway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?\\n\\nOne of the big reasons is that many, many people want something\\nbeyond this life.  You can pretend that they don\\'t want this, but I for\\none can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.\\n\\nAnd there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.\\nCan love as a truth be proven, logically?\\n\\n>>themselves, namely, a god or gods.  So in principle it\\'s hard to see how\\n>>theists are necessarily arrogant.\\n\\n>Makes no sense to me.  They seem arrogant to make such a claim to me.\\n>But my previous refutation still stands, and I believe there may be\\n>another one on the net.\\n\\nJohn the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see\\nhow that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast\\nin this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,\\nI do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,\\nyou might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,\\nJesus, for instance.\\n\\n>Are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism?  If you are\\n>talking about weak atheism which I believe in, then I refuse such a claim.\\n>Atheism is a lack of belief.  I used good ol\\' Occam\\'s Razor to make the\\n>final rejection of a deity, in that, as I see things, even if I\\n>present the hypothesises in an equal fasion, I find the theist argument\\n>not plausible.\\n\\nI speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence\\nsupporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting\\nlove as truth is subjective.\\n\\n>I believe I answered that.  I apologize for the (as you stated) incorrect\\n>assumption on your theism, but I saw nothing to indicate that you\\n>were an agnostic, only that you were just another newbie Christian\\n>on the net trying to get some cheap shots in.\\n\\nNo apology necessary.  :)\\n--\\nBake Timmons, III\\n\\n-- \"...there\\'s nothing higher, stronger, more wholesome and more useful in life\\nthan some good memory...\" -- Alyosha in Brothers Karamazov (Dostoevsky)\\n',\n",

They\\'re\\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\\nat working out the method itself.\\n\\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \\'obfuscate\\' the trick, and\\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\\nmaterial, much of which isn\\'t used.\\n\\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see\\nobject X, then perform action Y,\\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere.\\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\\nconclusions to draw from it\\'s experience.\\n\\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n>\\n>However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be\\n>able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue\\n>commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions\\n>occur?\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\\'d need more than U to explain R.)\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\\nexplainations for this. I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\\'t matter too\\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\\nphysics.\\n\\nI\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\\'s OK with you :-)\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>Petri\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\\n            Don\\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \\nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\\n\\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \\nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \\n\\n\\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\\nhasn\\'t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\\nresearch then it can\\'t be of any interest to us.\"  \\n\\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There\\'ve got to\\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\\n\\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world\\'s most \\nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \\nit doesn\\'t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \\nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \\nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\\nprocess doesn\\'t need to be repeated and the subject doesn\\'t need to\\npractice it over again at home.\\n\\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \\n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \\nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \\nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \\nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \\nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \\nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \\nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \\neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \\nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \\nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \\nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \\n\\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\nfrom scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \\npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don\\'t have any way of \\nknowing that it\\'s effective.\"  \\n\\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \\nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \\ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \\nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It\\'s described in a number of \\nbooks and I\\'ve posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \\ndetail as I\\'m capable of.)  \\n\\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \\nfavorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because it\\'s a\\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \\nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \\nattitudes about science.  \\n\\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \\nIf so, I apologize. \\n \\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

Remember, if you\\nasked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would\\nprobably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at\\nleast some were able to tolerate it.\\n\\nYou see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general\\nfrenzy.\\n\\n>>THe propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues, including\\n>>abortion and gays...  look at some of the things that have happened.\\n>Well, so far they have passed one amendment, which is currently under\\n>intense scrutiny, and they have failed to outlaw abortion, which is their\\n>prime goal on that issue. Yep, they seem sooo effective. Sure.\\n\\nWell, they haven\\'t managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity\\nof the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for\\npeople that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems\\nfor us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking\\nclinics, etc., but imagine what they\\'d have to do to stop atheism.\\n\\n>>>>Besides, the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people.\\n>>>Better than your one, that is, your opinion. Also, I have branched\\n>>>out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now.\\n>>And, what have they said?  Were you questions unbiased?\\n>Keith, you would claim that my questions are biased the minute I posted\\n>them, because the answers agreed with me. Everyone I have asked about\\n>the possible removal of the motto (the christian portion) has expressed\\n>regret about its loss, because they like it. However, when it is pointed\\n>out to them that a new motto will not be in the works, none have expressed\\n>the desire to rape, murder, pillage, etc., which you have basically claimed.\\n\\nSo, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a\\nwhole room of them?  A whole nation?\\n\\n>As for the atheist portion (I know some around here), they have all\\n>expressed disgust with the motto. Some noted being harassed by christians\\n>who used the motto to try to seem justified. And all would see it gone.\\n\\nYes, I\\'d be glad if it were gone to.  I\\'ve never supported it.  However,\\nI think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted\\nwith what *could* happen (an what may be likely).\\n\\n>>Which Christians designed the motto?  Does the motto say anything about\\n>>Jesus?  Why do you think that it refers *only* to Christians?\\n>Christians wrote it; christians think that their religion is right, and\\n>all others are wrong; therefore, why would they \\'include\\' other religions\\n>in the realm of being correct? I doubt that any other religions were meant\\n>to be included.\\n\\nWell, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the\\nmotto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed\\nin a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say,\\nbut I don\\'t think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively\\ndespise other religions?  Most that I have met haven\\'t and don\\'t do so.\\n\\n>>>No christian\\n>>>that I have queried thinks it means anything but them, and only them.\\n>>Why not ask some people of other faiths?\\n>Sorry, I would, but christianity is just so awfully popular around here.\\n>Suppose you could ask a few people?\\n\\nWell, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think\\nthat it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can\\'t say that these people\\n(just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their\\nfaiths.\\n\\n>>It is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any\\n>>given issue.  You are assuming that all the views were the same, and nothing\\n>>leads to this conclusion.\\n>Without evidence to the contrary, I doubt that there were dissenting\\n>opinions. You claim there were. Provide some evidence for your assertion.\\n\\nWell, I\\'d really like to, and I\\'ve tried, but I really don\\'t know where to\\nget access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950\\'s.  Can anyone help\\nout here?\\n\\n>Comparing christians to Nazis? Interesting.\\n\\nOnly in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.\\n\\n>>>>No, again, the motto on the money doesn\\'t cost you anything extra.  However,\\n>>>>if you abolished the motto, we\\'d all have to pay to have all the dies and\\n>>>>plates redone.\\n>>>Like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them.\\n>>You now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again.\\n\\n>... Also, I doubt that they use th3\\n>same plates for more than a year\\'s printing; this would make it easy\\n>to remove the motto (simply make next year\\'s plates without it). Your\\n>claim, evidently, is that they will have to pay extra somewhere.\\n>Provide some evidence for this assertion.\\n\\nSo, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?\\n\\nAnyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto\\nsomehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.\\n\\n>>The ones I read didn\\'t mention anything about Jesus.  I think the issue was\\n>>concerning the distinction between religion and not.\\n>How could it be between religious and not religious? The motto\\n>refers to god; it is a religious motto. The question is whether or\\n>not it is only christian. You say it is more. I doubt this. Provide\\n>some evidence for this assertion.\\n\\nThat is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of\\nthe USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included\\nall atheists, in general, as well.  I don\\'t think that any of the quotes\\n(although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus.\\nThey advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not\\nmentioned.\\n\\n>>You have missed this point.  I said that the motto didn\\'t say anything\\n>>about anyone in particular.  That is, the motto doesn\\'t imply anything\\n>>about *your* particular beliefs.  It doesn\\'t say that everyone trusts\\n>>in some form of god, only that the nation on the whole does.\\n>We have been through this before. It\\'s obvious it does not include me;\\n>this much is beyond doubt. Your claim, again, is that the motto refers\\n>to more than christians. Based on the facts that christianity says all\\n>other religions are wrong, and because it seems that the motto was\\n>written by christians, I doubt your claim.\\n\\nSo, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions\\nshould be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That\\'s silly.\\nI think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don\\'t advocate their banishment.\\n\\n>[...]  Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would\\n>even be incurred by removing the motto. Provide some evidence for your\\n>claim that it would.\\n\\nI think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight\\ncost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by\\nbeing on our currency.\\n\\n>Disregarding the digression of the other motto...If it is used for\\n>harassment, and no other purpose has been found for it, why should\\n>it not be removed?\\n\\nWell, mottos in general don\\'t really have purposes...  I don\\'t think it\\nshould be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the\\nconsequences.\\n\\n>>And do you know what the vote was?  Were there other opinions?  Do you\\n>>think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother\\n>>atheists?  Do you think that this is what the majority of congress at\\n>>the time had in mind?  If you do, then show why.\\n>Again, it is the opinion of the people who put it there that I am\\n>concerned with.\\n\\nThen you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.\\n\\n>Again, it is not necessary that the complete majority\\n>shared the purpose of confronting \\'godless Communism\\' with this motto.\\n\\nWhy not?  It is the majority that put it there.\\n\\n>>The general public probably does not know about the anti-atheist intent\\n>>of a few people in the 50\\'s either.\\n>I daresay more people remember the 50\\'s than the time when Key wrote\\n>the anthem.\\n\\nBut do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember\\nthat some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don\\'t\\nyou include this in your little survey that you were conducting?\\n\\n[...]\\n>You claim here that scientists would believe someone\\'s claims. I doubt\\n>this. Provide evidence for your assertion.\\n\\nWhat?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein\\nsaid about relativity is worthy?  I mean, if Einstein said it, there\\'s a\\ngood chance that it was right (at least at the time).\\n\\n>As for the courts, the\\n>method scientists use can be applied. I need not agree with the court\\n>by default because of a \\'good record.\\'\\n\\nYou need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think\\nthat their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.\\n\\n>>What?  But you said you didn\\'t agree with the court because they \"allowed\\n>>Congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning.\"  If\\n>>you don\\'t realize that something like this is external to the realm of\\n>>the court\\'s power, then how can I be confident that you know *anything*\\n>>about the court\\'s powers?  I mean, if you don\\'t know how the court works,\\n>>how can you participate in a discussion of the court?\\n>A judge can go to speak before Congress. And still you ignore the\\n>abortion gag rule, as you make your claims on abortion.\\n\\nNo, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court\\nJustice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a\\nConstitutional Amendment.\\n\\nAnd, in order for the Court to rule on something, a case usually must be\\npresented.\\n\\n>>Mushrooms, flowers, trees, buildings, signs, whatever...  the analogy is\\n>>the same.

I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.\\n#The point is that theism is *a* factor.\\n\\nThat\\'s your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful\\nas the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore\\nbelief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this\\nis *any* belief, not belief in Gods)\\n\\n#>Gullibility,\\n#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more\\n#>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of\\n#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators\\n#>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.\\n# \\n#That\\'s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the\\n#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.\\n\\nIf you believe that, you\\'re incredibly naive.\\n\\n#>Now, *some*\\n#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\\n#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned\\n#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction\\n#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?\\n#>\\n#That\\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\\n#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\\n#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\\n#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\\n\\nNo, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\\nwith *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\\'t implied by\\nwhat you say before, because you\\'re trying to sneak in \"innate features\\nof [all] theism\".  The word you\\'re groping for is \"some\".\\n\\n#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n\\nNo shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\nsince it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\nto the case you are trying to make?\\n\\n#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\\n#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.\\n\\nI said it reads like a warm up to that.  That\\'s because it\\'s an irrational\\nand bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us \\nsplit in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either\\nside of church walls.\\n\\n#>|>(2)  Define \"irrational belief\".  e.g., is it rational to believe that\\n#>|>     reason is always useful?\\n#>|>\\n#>|\\n#>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason.

One point is that\\n#>|the beliefs violate reason often, and another that a process that does\\n#>|not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information.\\n#>\\n#>Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful\\n#>based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would\\n#>be irrational.  Which is it?\\n#>\\n#That\\'s bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of\\n#usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.\\n\\nO.K., it\\'s oval.  It\\'s still begging the question, however.  And though\\nthat certainly is allowed, it\\'s not rational.  And you claiming to be\\nrational and all.\\n\\nAt the risk of repeating myself, and hearing \"we had that before\" [we\\ndidn\\'t hear a _refutation_ before, so we\\'re back.   Deal with it] :\\nyou can\\'t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone\\nwho thinks reason is crap won\\'t buy it, you see.\\n\\n#Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics\\n#and mathematics are therfore circular.\\n\\nAnybody else think Godel was silly?\\n\\n#>The first part of the second statement contains no information, because\\n#>you don\\'t say what \"the beliefs\" are.  If \"the beliefs\" are strong theism\\n#>and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The\\n#>second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an\\n#>axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is\\n#>assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is\\n#>used to obtain it.\\n#>\\n# \\n#I\\'ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions\\n#of god here.\\n# \\n#An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here\\n#is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the\\n#axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\\n#out of which they are usually derived. \"I exist\" is derived, if you want\\n#it that way.\\n#\\n#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\\n# \\n#what is it you are trying to say?\\n\\nThat at some point, people always wind up saying \"this datum is reliable\" \\nfor no particular reason at all.  Example: \"I am not dreaming\".\\n\\n#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of\\n#>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.\\n#>\\n#>I can\\'t agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To\\n#>say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which\\n#>I suspect you do not have.\\n#>\\n# \\n#Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities\\n#with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or\\n#the way the world works.\\n\\nIMO, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does\\nnot mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of\\nintelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists, for example.\\n\\n#>|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen. It has to be true because I believe\\n#>|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. However, the beliefs say they are\\n#>|more than a work hypothesis.\\n#>\\n#>I don\\'t understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?\\n# \\n#Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make\\n#B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that\\n#it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating\\n#evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)\\n#says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further\\n#contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can\\n#have interesting effects.\\n\\nPeculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief\\nin gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren\\'t my \\ncatholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they \\ndon\\'t believe in it.  Maybe it\\'s the conjunction of \"B asserts B\" and\\n\"jail/kill dissenters\" that is important, and the belief in gods is\\nentirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no\\naxe to grind here. \\n\\n-- \\nFrank O\\'Dwyer                                  \\'I\\'m not hatching That\\'\\nodwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\\n',\n",

Who is he? \\n>Please do not answer with \"A well known evolutionist\" or some other such\\n>informationless phrase.\\n\\n   Francis Hitching is the author of, among other books,\\n_The Neck of the Giraffe_.\" He believes evolution is\\ndirected by some sort of cosmic force, but does not like\\nDarwinism.  He wrote in this book [ _The Neck of the\\nGiraffe_, Ticknor & Fields, New Haven, Connecticut, 1982,\\np. 12 (p. 4, paperback)] that:\\n\\n   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the\\n   great unifying principle of biology, Darwinism, after\\n   a century and a quarter, is in a surprising amount of\\n   trouble.  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to\\n   mean the same thing.  But they don\\'t.  Evolution of\\n   life over a very long period of time is a fact, if we\\n   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two\\n   centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biol-\\n   ogy and many other scientific disciplines.  Despite\\n   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this\\n   ..., the probability that evolution has occurred\\n   approaches certainty in scientific terms....  On the\\n   other hand Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, its modern\\n   version) is a theory that seeks to explain evolution.\\n   It has not, contrary to general belief, and despite\\n   very great efforts, been proved.\\n\\n   Research on Hitching turned up the following: Hitching is\\nbasically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien-\\ntific credentials.  In _The Neck of the Giraffe_ he claimed\\nto be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, but an\\ninquiry to that institute said he was not.  He implied in\\nthe \"Acknowledgements\" of _The Neck of the Giraffe_ that\\npaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writing\\nof the book, but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know him\\nand had no information about him.  Hitching also implied\\nthat his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins, but upon\\ninquiry Dawkins stated: \"I know nothing at all about Francis\\nHitching.  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char-\\nlatan, good for you.  His book, _The Neck of the Giraffe,_\\nis one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read for\\nyears.\"\\n\\n   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written on\\nMayan pyramid energy and for some \"In Search Of...\" episodes\\non BBC television.  The reference work _Contemporary\\nAuthors,_ Vol. 103, page 208, lists him as a member of the\\nSociety for Psychical Research, the British Society of\\nDowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers.  His writ-\\nings include: _Earth Magic,_ _Dowsing: The Psi Connection,_\\n_Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained,_ _Fraud,\\nMischief, and the Supernatural_ and _Instead of Darwin_.\\n\\n   Hitching\\'s book spends much of its time attacking Dar-\\nwinian evolution, borrowing heavily and uncritically from\\nyoung-earth creationist arguments.  Many of Hitching\\'s \"ref-\\nerences\" are lifted from young-earth creationist literature\\nrather than being quoted directly from their original\\nsources.  One magazine had this to say [_Creation/Evolution\\nNewsletter_, 7, No. 5, pp. 15-16, September/October 1987]:\\n\\n   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society, there was\\n   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of\\n   their journal Biblical Creation (p. 74) concerning a\\n   review of Francis Hitching\\'s 1982 book _The Neck of\\n   the Giraffe_.  Hitching\\'s book is strongly anti-\\n   Darwinist, and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre-\\n   ationists (though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist\\n   creationists).  The letter, by creationist Malcolm\\n   Bowden (author of _The Rise of the Evolution Fraud_),\\n   points out that Hitching simply \"culled his informa-\\n   tion from the creationist literature.\"  This is indeed\\n   the case:  many creationist works are cited favorably\\n   (Anderson, Coffin, Clark, Daly, Davidheiser, Dewar,\\n   Gish, Morris, Segraves, Whitcomb, and Wysong, plus\\n   various anti-Darwinists).  Hitching does cite Bowden\\'s\\n   earlier book _Ape-Men -- Fact or Fallacy?_, but Bowden\\n   accuses Hitching of \"lifting\" several passages and\\n   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment:\\n   in other words, plagiarism.  \"Hitchin\\'s [sic] book is\\n   largely an exposition of the creationists [sic] view-\\n   point from the beginning to almost the end,\" Bowden\\n   points out....  Hitching is also a paranormalist, an\\n   advocate of psychic evolution.... [Hitching\\'s book]\\n   _Earth Magic_ is a wild, extremely entertaining and\\n   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc-\\n   tures....  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic\\n   cataclysms, Atlantis, pyramidology, dowsing, ESP,\\n   miraculous healing, and astrology.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAlan Feuerbacher\\nalanf@atlas.pen.tek.com\\n\\n',\n",

Addressing loss\\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.

I do\\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\n> Stuff deleted\\n> Also, I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that\\n> Khomeini\\'s fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.

If my view is correct, then\\n> your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for a \"crime in progress\" is\\n> incorrect.\\n> \\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\\n\\nP.S. I\\'m not sure about this but I think the charge of \"shatim\" also\\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\\nof the \"fasad\" ruling.\\n',\n",

He assumed that\\n##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by-\\n##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\\n##it)?  \\n##\\n\\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\\nscience.

As soon as you possibly can.  The\\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\\nthese kinds of problems.  DON\\'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\\n\\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\\na wonderful report by New Zealand\\'s Department of Labour (Occupational\\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner\\'s Guide\".\\n\\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn\\'t have your hands):\\n(note: you\\'re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\\n\\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\\n\\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\\nconditions.  Local problems are what you\\'d expect: specific muscles,\\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\\ntenderness in muscles, although they\\'re not necessarily \"the problem.\"\\n\\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here\\'s the theory.\\n\\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\\nthe blood flow.  By the time you\\'re exerting 50% of your full power,\\nyou\\'re completely restricting your blood flow.\\n\\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\\n\\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\\nand the cycle continues.\\n\\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\\n\\nAnyway, when you\\'re typing too much, you\\'re never really giving a change\\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\\nergonomics, only make things worse.\\n\\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\\n\\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\\n\\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath\\'s ability\\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\\ninflamed, and you\\'ve got your problem.\\n\\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\\nwith repetitive activity.\\n\\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\\n\\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as \\'neural tension\\', this is where\\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \\ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \\n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\\n\\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there\\'s a fancy name for\\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\\n\\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\\n\\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\\nIf you\\'re under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\\nthree minutes.  It\\'s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\\ncalm down, and relax.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\\n\\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what\\'s best\\nfor you.\\n\\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I\\'m lifting it almost verbatim from\\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\\n\\n. Let your shoulders relax.\\n. Let your elbows swing free.\\n. Keep your wrists straight.\\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don\\'t flop your head forward.\\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\\n. Don\\'t slouch or slump forward.\\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\\n\\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \\nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\\n\\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\\nfootrest.\\n\\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\\narea.\\n\\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\\n\\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\\n\\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don\\'t like your chair, go\\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that\\'s right for you.\\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\\nname says it all.\\n\\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\\n\\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\\nshouldn\\'t be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It\\'s\\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\\ndeviated hands.\\n\\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\\n\\n==5== Requests for more info\\n\\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\\nis incomplete.  There\\'s always more information out there.  If you\\'d like\\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I\\'ll gladly throw it in.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\\nwonderful!  I\\'d love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I\\'d\\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I\\'d love somebody to edit the\\nabove sections, looking for places where I\\'ve obviously goofed.\\n\\n==6== References\\n\\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

Corrections and\\nattempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.\\n\\nAnyway, since I seem to be the only one following this particular line\\nof discussion, I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have\\nread this book?

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\\nwould call Japan, etc.\\n\\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nAllan Weber\\nSignal & Image Processing Institute\\nUniversity of Southern California\\nweber@sipi.usc.edu\\n\",\n",

Paul\\'s letters are\\nindeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions.  They are, as\\na result, the most historically solid books in the NT.  Paul\\'s claims and\\ndescriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be \"wie es eigent-\\nlich gewesen\" -- but they are most definitely the comments of a participant!\\nIn other words, we\\'d evaluate Paul\\'s statements more or less as we would\\nthe testimony of a witness in court.\\n\\nThe gospels are another story altogether.  Luke is most assuredly NOT a\\nfirsthand witness.  He *claims* to have gathered material that is closer\\nto the actual events -- but this is a conventional claim in ancient books\\nand Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in his\\nbook(s) which derive from any source *we* can detect behind Luke.  John\\nhas a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloved\\ndisciple (who is NOT named.)  We are not bound to accept this claim (for\\na long time, some scholars rejected it outright), but even if we do, it\\nmakes the fourth gospel as we have it *at best* secondhand.  Neither Mark\\nnor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand.  Later (much later) Christian\\ntradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaic\\nproto-gospel, and associates Mark with Peter as having something like the\\nsame second-hand status of recounting Peter\\'s preaching of the gospel.\\n\\nSuch traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate the\\nactual data before us.  Luke and Matthew both appear to use (differently!)\\nan anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of _logoi_ (words and\\ndeeds) of Jesus, as well as to be dependent on Mark.  This makes their\\ntestimony AT LEAST thirdhand.\\n\\nAll that said, historians DO attempt to glean whatever they can from the\\nNT sources, and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources for\\nanything about the earliest Church.  They are also *extremely* important\\nfor the light they cast (however refracted through Christian biases) on\\nthe sectarian world of Judaism just before and around the time of the\\ndestruction of the 2nd Temple.\\n\\nThe problem of \"the historical Jesus\" is tricky, however.  There is a\\ncycle of fashion on this (and we are now near a major \"high\" in people\\nthinking they *can* discern [with historico-critical plausibility] some-\\nthing about Jesus\\' life and opinions from the NT.  The difficulty here\\n(which dominated thinking 50 years ago, and will probably return to favor\\nin another generation :-)) was pointed out by Bultmann, after Schweitzer\\'s\\ntreatment at the end of the previous high-point on the cycle -- simply\\nBECAUSE all our sources have passed through AT LEAST one layer of quite\\nanonymous shaping WITHIN the early Church, we have no easy and reliable\\nway to distribute ANY part of the material between \"real\" history and the\\ninventions of the Church.  There are few \"radical skeptics\" who think we\\nhave nothing of history in the gospels [though such a position can be\\nmaintained], but neither have we any tools that can distinguish \"shaping\"\\nof real historical material by its communal use as opposed to \"invention.\"\\n--\\nMichael L.

First, you are discussing only\\nexperimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The\\nmain criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make\\nprediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be\\nthe result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity\\noccuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of\\nthe lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the\\nobservations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science -\\nit is\\n*not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted\\nsense.\\n\\nSecondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just\\nthe\\nrequirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.\\nThe\\nobservation of a fossil is \\'repeatable\\', since any qualified observer\\nmay\\nlook at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also,\\nthere is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will\\ncorrespond\\nto the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is\\ntested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some\\nconclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.\\n\\nUnfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been\\nperipheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the\\nfront legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,\\nrather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).\\n\\nSo, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the\\nnecessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the\\noriginal\\nevent does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.\\n\\n[This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-\\nterrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determination\\nof the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].\\n\\n--\\nsarima@teradata.com                     (formerly tdatirv!sarima)\\n  or\\nStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com\\n\\nsarima@teradata.com\\t\\t\\t(formerly tdatirv!sarima)\\n  or\\nStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com\\n\\n',\n",

Back\\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \\nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \\nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \\nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

If\\n> Iraq is so bad, why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before\\n> we started bombing?\\n\\nI make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the\\nWest before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.

Or to allow them to continue with mass\\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I\\'d have to\\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\\n> \\n>> So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?

It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.

How true. This claim would\\nlend substantial support to the notion that religions are actually\\nseamless virtual realities.\\n\\nDoes god exist or not? To us, this question is a true dichotomy.\\n\\nCan god know a reason for her existence? If she is omniscient, then\\nshe must know this. There is a philosophical problem whether anything\\ncan exist without a time frame - for instance, if it were possible to\\nobserve our universe from \\'outside\\', in the neverness surrounding\\nthis universe, it would never have existed. \\n\\nThus, we are faced with a trilemma:\\n\\n1) God \\'meta-exists\\', and from this meta-existing perspective she\\ncreated existence, the Universe and everything. \\n\\nThis implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing, which\\nis precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis (Lizhi & Shuxian: \\nCreation of the Universe) say. This \\'nothingness\\' is not empty enough,\\nit is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence,\\nuntil (there is no \\'when\\' yet, but never mind) god, the source of\\nall existence, started to play. I fail to see the difference between\\nthese two forms of nothingness, though. If there isn\\'t one, it might\\nbe god is not necessary for creation.\\n\\nIt is obvious that the levels of \\'meta-existence\\' are not necessarily\\nlimited to god, there might be a \\'meta-god\\' on some other level.\\n\\n2) God exists, and has always existed (she has a timescale, which\\nis different from our own). This sounds sensible, but it is difficult\\nto conceive how she could know why she exists - a being which\\nhas always existed, and is infinitely conscious of itself, can\\nremember that she has always been the same, and perhaps know herself\\ncompletely, but she cannot know why she exists, and how she knows\\neverything she knows. Would a knowledge of how a being with a \\npersonality (a subjective viewpoint) knows everything be this\\nbeing\\'s knowledge? A conscious being conscious of everything is\\nactually a contradiction in terms - it means that god is only\\nconscious of herself, since we, and the whole universe, are\\nalready incorporated in her mental models, thoroughly modelled.\\nActually, a conscious being conscious of only itself is not\\nconscious at all. \\n\\n3) God is herself the Existence. This is nothing more than an Orwellian\\nredefinition of the word existence. A logical consequence of this\\nstatement is that god is actually _all_ existence. I think this is\\nalso called a form of pantheism.\\n\\n: If this\\n: being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\\n: defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\\n: He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\\n: self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\\n: objective sense.\\n\\nIn a reality god is supposed to have created, I cannot believe in\\nher, is that my fault or the creator\\'s fault? God gave me freedom\\nof choice, but nevertheless knows what I will opt for, is it fair\\nplay on her side?\\n\\nIf god has a conscious mind, in any sense, she has a point of view.\\nI\\'d say she is entitled to her opinions about me, but I still insist\\nthat any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with \\nresistance and disapproval. \\n\\n: If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\\n\\nNo, an objective standard means something independent on _any_\\nsubjective viewpoint, _including_ god\\'s point of view. \\n\\n: If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\\n: standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\\n: morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\\n: meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\\n: misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\\n: meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\\n\\nWhat standard? My morality (and my conscience)  disagrees with the\\n\\'standards\\' of the Bible. Which one to ignore? How to interpret\\nany divine standard? There is a great discrepancy even among \\nChristians on this. For instance, the Bible does not condemn\\nfemale homosexuality - why many Christians do, thinking god doesn\\'t\\naccept it anyway?\\n\\nBill, to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make the\\nterm nebulous. Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour,\\nsomething we can change, and something that _must_ change when\\nsocieties change. It might be some basic concepts are hard-wired\\nin our brains by evolution, but in the end, we must decide ourselves.\\nI don\\'t think people need religion to keep them moral; \\nthinking goes beyond threat of punishment. \\n\\n: Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\\n: infinitely malleable, doesn\\'t mean that the objective standard itself\\n: doesn\\'t exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\\n: norm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\\n: subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\\n\\nI\\'ve yet to see an objective standard that is \\n\\na) universally applicable (today and tomorrow)\\nb) universally acceptable (not against our own concepts of what is\\nmoral and what isn\\'t)\\n\\n: Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\\n: nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\\n: contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\\n: much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it\\n: or not, it\\'s there.\\n\\nI don\\'t think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard,\\nalthough it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time,\\nand much of it is still applicable. The problem is that I can\\'t\\nagree with it all. This is not a question of comforting my\\nconscience with a thought that \"I won\\'t be responsible with what\\nI do\", as Christians would put it.

Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus \\nin the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors \\nin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may \\nbe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care \\nto comment?).\\n\\nMost stones will pass(but it\\'s a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, \\nI don\\'t think that there are many drugs that can help \"dissolve\" the \\nkidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium \\nhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the \\naterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could \\nspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I\\'m pretty confident that \\na diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery \\nis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second \\nopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break \\nup the stone if it\\'s logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung \\ndisease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side\\n-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also \\nbinds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when \\nEDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that \\nwere not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove \\ncalcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C \\nand magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra \\nvitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium \\nfrom the plaques).\\n\\nThe calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably \\ncan be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nJohn Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.\\n\\n       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: \"Don\\'t think that I have come to\\n       bring peace on earth.  I haven\\'t come to bring peace,\\n       but rather a sword.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Where do they come \\n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\\n#whatever is societally mandated.\\n\\nIt\\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don\\'t let yourself\\ndo it.

It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \\nFamilies USA.\\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \\nthat doctors make too much money.\\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \\nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \\nOK.\\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \\nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \\nand are still simmering.\\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \\nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \\nof Americans don\\'t make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \\ndo are stealing it from them.\\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don\\'t  kid  yourself.  \\nKarl Marx lives.\\n     It\\'s also stupid because it didn\\'t ask key  questions,  such \\nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \\nbecome a physician?\\n     If those polled said no,  they didn\\'t know, then they should \\nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \\nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \\na doctor should earn if they don\\'t know what it takes to become a \\ndoctor?\\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \\nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \\ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \\nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \\ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \\nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \\nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \\nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \\n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \\nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \\ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \\ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \\nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \\nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \\nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \\nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \\ncalled together to remake America\\'s health care.\\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \\nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \\nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \\nto health what Clinton\\'s first budget is to frugality.\\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \\nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \\nmajor cause of high medical costs.\\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \\nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \\nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \\na McDonald\\'s?\\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \\na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \\ncabbages.\\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \\nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \\ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \\nthey might have been more honest if they had said:\\n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \\nproblems we have.

They are usually GPs.\\n\\nNo, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the\\ncountry, you don\\'t need to be known as an LD \"specialist\" to see a large\\nnumber of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of\\nunderdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just\\nabout every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,\\nhe sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not\\nthe only orthopedists in the town.\\n\\nLet\\'s say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the\\n*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage\\nmanifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by\\nneurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem\\nwe have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD\\npatient.\\n\\nHe refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the\\npatient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to\\nthe knees).\\n\\nGordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.\\n\\n-Marc.\\n-- \\n--\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n              Marc C.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"\\n\\nÿ\\n',\n",

I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain.\\nHe suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I\\nneed to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may\\nmonitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.\\n\\nI did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary).\\nI explained to her that I was following up at the doctor\\'s request,\\nand that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more\\nfrequent and the medication did not seem effective.\\n\\nThe doctor called me back, and his first words were, \"Whatever you want,\\nyou\\'d better make it quick.  I\\'m very busy and don\\'t have time to chit-\\nchat with you!\"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to\\ncall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I \\nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\\nhad more time.  He responded, \"Just spit it out now because no time is\\na good time.\"  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\\nand then said \"well, never mind\" and he said he\\'ll talk to various\\ncolleagues about other medications and he\\'ll call me some other time.\\n\\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn\\'t express\\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I\\nwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering\\nhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told\\nme that he just doesn\\'t have time to \"rap with patients\" and thought\\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\\n\"rap\" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \\nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\\nthis apology: \"I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don\\'t have a lot of\\ntime to deal with that.\"  He then told me to call him the next day\\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\\n\\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\\n\\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\\nnow I am afraid to call him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t--Marlena\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n\\n-- \\nRobert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project\\t\\nInternet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research Institute\\nUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of Toronto\\nBitnet:\\t  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA\\n',\n",

Dr. Noordewier has \\nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \\nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \\nto his current work in computational biology.\\n\\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \\n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\\n\\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \\npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \\napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \\nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \\nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \\nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \\naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \\nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \\nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \\nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \\nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \\n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \\n National Laboratory) \\n\\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \\nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \\nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \\ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \\nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \\ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \\napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \\nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \\nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \\ntechniques in this domain.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \\n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\\n\\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \\nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \\ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \\nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \\ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \\nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \\nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \\nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \\nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \\nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \\na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \\nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \\nthe field.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \\n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \\n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\\n\\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \\nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \\ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \\npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \\ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \\nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \\nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \\nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \\nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \\nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \\nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \\nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \\nof word-based analyses.\\n\\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\\n\\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \\nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\\nmind...\\n\\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\\nintended for.\\n\\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\\nkill by their leaders.\\n\\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \\n\\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\\nparts of Man's history.@\\n\\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\\n\\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\\n\\n-ciao\\n\\n-chris blask\\n\",\n",

A short, positive assertion would be nice.\\n#>\\n#>As I hope you can tell, (b) and (c) are actually predicated on\\n#>the assumption that values are real  - so statements like these\\n#>_can\\'t_ consistently derive from the relativist assumption that values\\n#>aren\\'t part of objective reality.\\n#\\n#I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you\\n#phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of \"right\"\\n#and \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the\\n#domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\\n#sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\\n#legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\\n#\\n#Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\\n#of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\\n#One can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\\n#veridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\\n#sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\\n#strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\\n#certainly ask that question about motives.\\n#\\n#Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\\'t be considered:\\n#they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\\n\\nTrue, by \"correct\" I mean \"the thing valued is really good\".  I should\\nuse evaluative terms, but I don\\'t always.  Sorry for the sloppy phrasing.\\nCan you answer if \"betterness\" is used in in place of @correctness\"?\\n#\\n#Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\\n#the first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\\n#meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\\n#irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\\n#one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\\n#value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\"\\n#of the position.\\n\\nYou can never say that the thing is @really better@, or \"more likely\\nto better, from all realistic frames of reference\"?\\n\\n#\\n#Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is\\n#that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,\\n#neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).

My definition\\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\\nwork.  Lee Lady writes:\\n\\n> I don\\'t think that science should be defined in a way that some \\n> of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely\\n> thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as\\n> scientific work.  \\n\\nUnless one classifies \"thinking and informal exploration\" as a\\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\\nunscientific.  \\n\\nIn article <C5nAsF.MH7@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes:\\n> Seriously, I\\'m not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  \\n> I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science \\n> is mainly about avoiding mistakes. ...\\n\\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\\n\"mainly about.\"\\n\\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\\n\\n> Okay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\n> of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\n> controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\n> extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\n> treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \\n> if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\\n> a treatment is useful. ...\\n>\\n> SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \\n> evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \\n\\nI agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only\\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \\n\\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \\n\\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\\n\\n> The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\n> make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\n> will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\n> many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\n> afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\n> the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\n> scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\n> from scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nI think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --\\ndeserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When\\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\\nresearchers\\' minds.  \\n\\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\\nwants to become this generation\\'s Rhine.\\n\\n> One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\n> unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\n> been described in a scientific journal. ...\\n\\nI think this is absurd.  \\n\\n> Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done \\n> (with favorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because\\n> it\\'s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\\neases one\\'s defense.)\\n\\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little\\nabout either and so have nothing to offer.\\n\\nRussell\\n',\n",

You can\\'t repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that\\nproduced life. So it seems we could never say, \"That\\'s exactly how it happened.\"As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted\\nit. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,\\nstrictly speaking, are lacking.\\n-- \\n\\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Joe Duffy                          duffy@asl.dl.nec.com  |\\n| NEC America, Inc.                                        |\\n',\n",

Suppose\\nfurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by any\\nnation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country\\nat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the\\nUS see fit.  The US would be militarily \"omnipotent\".\\n\\nBut suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not\\ninterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current\\ncivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.\\n\\nTechnically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to \\nunilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But\\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \\nof non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to\\nstrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would\\never be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it\\ncould actually do, although it had the power to do \"whatever it wanted\".\\nThe US would simply \"never want to interfere\" for such an idea would\\nbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate\\nnon-interference policy.\\n\\nGod is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but\\nHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what\\nHe, Himself is.\\n\\nI hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning\\nomnipotence.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nJim B.\\n',\n",

It is more than 99 percent \\neffective.\\n\\n\"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent \\npregnancy,\" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. \"As an injectable, \\ngiven once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to \\nmissing a daily dose.\"\\n\\nDepo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and \\nclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive \\nprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \\ninjections.\\n\\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \\nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \\nbefore making a decision to use it.\\n\\nDepo Provera\\'s effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \\nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \\nin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo \\nProvera effective as an injectable contraceptive.\\n\\nThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In \\naddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, \\ndizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have \\nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \\nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\\n\\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \\ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \\nosteoporosis.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \\ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \\nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \\ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \\nvisual impairment \\n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \\nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \\ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \\ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \\nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \\n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \\nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \\nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \\n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \\nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \\nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \\nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \\nYancoooulos, Regeneron\\'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \\nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \\nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \\nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \\nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \\nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \\nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \\nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \\nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \\n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron\\'s Director of \\nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF\\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \\nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \\nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \\ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \\nsurgically.\" \\n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \\nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \\nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \\nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \\nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \\nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \\n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \\nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \\nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \\nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson\\'s disease, and Alzheimer\\'s disease. By \\nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \\nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease). \\n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \\nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \\nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \\ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans.

These findings, according to \\ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \\nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \\ncountries. \\n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \\nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \\nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \\nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \\ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \\nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \\nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \\n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \\nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \\nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \\nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \\nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \\ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \\nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \\nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \\nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \\n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \\nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \\nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \\ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \\nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \\napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \\npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \\nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \\nlow in cholesterol and fat.\\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \\nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \\nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \\nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\\ncholesterol. \\n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \\nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \\nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \\nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \\ninvestigators\\' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \\nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \\nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \\ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \\nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \\nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \\nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \\n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \\npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \\nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \\nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \\nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \\nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \\nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \\nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet\\'s potential to elevate the cholesterol \\nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \\naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\\'s \"affluent\" diet used in the study \\nranks a CSI of 149. \\n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \\nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \\nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \\ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \\nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \\nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \\nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \\ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \\ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \\nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \\na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \\n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects\\' mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \\nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \\nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \\nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \\nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \\nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake. \\n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \\naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \\nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given society\\'s elite, who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \\nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                             General Announcments\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \\ncalling the NCI\\'s Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).\\n\\nYou can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the\\nClassic Example, but there are probably others.\\n\\nIridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By\\nlooking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises\\nyou are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.\\n\\nThe two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:\\n\\n1: How does it work?\\n\\n2: What evidence is there?\\n\\nThe answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to\\nevaluate.  I don\\'t know about iridology, but I\\'ve read a book on\\nreflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the\\norgans of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are\\nsupposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or\\nenergy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.\\n(Always beware the words \"channel\" and \"energy\" in any spiel put out\\nby an alternative practitioner.)\\n\\nThe answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is\\nanecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in\\nmainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of\\nrich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done\\nand papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.\\n\\nThe word \"licensed\" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by\\nwhom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and\\nrequires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong\\nplants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove\\nand Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license\\nextends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be\\ntold that it means \"(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist\".\\n\\nBTW, the usual term is \"herbalist\".  Why use a different word?\\n\\n-- \\nPaul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).\\t    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245\\n--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------\\nThese ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is not\\nfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions\\n',\n",

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nFor information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.\\nÿ\\n',\n",

King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\\n\\n * \"The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\\n *  treated as a matter of faith.\" -- Francis Hitching                     *\\n\\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\\n\\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\\n    not be your real intent.\\n\\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\\n\\n\\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\\n\\n * Neither I, nor Webster\\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\\n\\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings\\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\\n\\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\\ntitled \"`Giraffe\\' sticks scientific neck out too far\".  Excerpts include :\\n\\n  \"Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.\"  \"He goes after Darwin like Mark\\n  Antony after Brutus.
